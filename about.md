## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Eduardo, a cybersecurity student from Brazil. Iâ€™m all about learning how to keep things safe online and messing around with tech stuff.

When Iâ€™m not diving into hacking challenges or geeking out over gadgets, youâ€™ll probably find me practicing capoeira or rolling on the mat with some jiu jitsu.

Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to say hi or talk about martial arts!
