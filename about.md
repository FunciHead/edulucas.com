## Hey! 👋

I’m Eduardo, a cybersecurity student from Brazil. I’m all about learning how to keep things safe online and messing around with tech stuff.

When I’m not diving into hacking challenges or geeking out over gadgets, you’ll probably find me practicing capoeira or rolling on the mat with some jiu jitsu.
